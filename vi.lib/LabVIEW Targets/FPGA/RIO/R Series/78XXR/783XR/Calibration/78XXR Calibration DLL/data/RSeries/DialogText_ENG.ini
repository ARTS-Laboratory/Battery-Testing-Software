[CALIBRATION]
IDS_TARGET_DOESNT_HAVE_CAL_SUPPORT=The selected device is a %s.  This utility only supports NI 78xxR devices that have analog input and analog output channels.
IDS_UNKNOWN_TYPE=unknown type
IDS_MUST_SAVE_TO_FLASH_TIP_STRIP=You must save the calibratiOn results to flash for this device.
IDS_SELF_CAL_WARNINGS=During self-calibration, the analog output channel values are updated. Make sure that equipment connected to the analog output channels will not be affected by this process.\0A\0ASelf-calibration typically takes 1-2 minutes to complete for local devices but may take 5-6 minutes to complete for remote devices.
